The staff were helpful, friendly and fun and our room (over looking Rugby Park) was large and roomy with plenty of space for ski gear and the bed was very very comfortable.  Breakfast was included and covered just about all the food groups including fresh fruit.  Happy hour (from 3-7) was so good with great cocktails and the pizzas were the best ever!  The hot tubs and pool were just the thing after a day skiing.  We noticed that the rooms were extremely quiet and the fridge and heating system was a lot quieter than the hotel we stayed at in Canyons, Utah."]},

It is a family friendly hotel, but was still \u201cnice\u201d, clean, and well-appointed for adults that appreciate an upscale hotel.  First of all, I\u2019m sure that this week is the most busy of the entire year, but we never once had to wait to speak with the front desk, for an elevator, for gym equipment, for a drink/food at breakfast, etc, which was a miracle!  This speaks (in my opinion) to the great service and staff.  Everyone was super helpful.  We had our 7.5 month baby with us, and everyone on the staff went out of their way to greet him and help us with anything we needed, including providing a car seat for our airport pickup and drop off.  Our room was great \u2013 on the 3rd floor with a great view of the park and the mountains beyond.  We loved watching the dogs run around the park in the snow.  We were honestly shocked at how spacious the room was, with plenty of room for us to spread out and for the baby to have room to play.  Fireplace and bar area in the room were great touches, plus ample storage for all of our stuff (and as anyone traveling with a baby knows, it is a LOT of stuff).  The room was clean and updated as well.  Food in the lounge was great \u2013 breakfast was of great variety and all was good.  I was surprised by how great the afternoon/dinner offerings were \u2013 we ate dinner at the hotel our first night and did \u201cto go\u201d in our room on the last night \u2013 everything was delicious!   I also appreciated the various \"green\" practices featured by the hotel - from lights and fireplaces on timers to amenities in pumps vs. tiny plastic bottles.  Very thoughtful without taking away from convenience or comfort. The ONE and ONLY negative feature of our entire experience (there has to be one, right?) was that noise from the hallway carried so loudly.  There were kids running up and down the hall screaming and knocking on each other\u2019s\u2019 doors, and I lived in fear that it was going to wake up the baby at night.  It was not that there was noise from the adjacent rooms, just from the hallway, so I wonder if the doors could be sealed better.  All in all, I was originally disappointed that we wouldn\u2019t be staying at the Little Nell, but after staying at Limelight this week I cannot IMAGINE having done anything differently.  This hotel met all of our needs and then some, and I am so glad we stayed here!"]},

We stayed at a different hotel for 4 nights this year because I booked late and the prices where a tad bit too expensive. But ill be honest it did not compare to the limelight hotel. My girlfriend and I had to at least stay 1 night before heading back to California. We strolled in 2 days before Thanksgiving and chatted with Marty at the front desk. Marty was friendly, polite and happy to see us back. Told him we have to at least stay 1 night before we head back home and he got us a room. I can write plenty about the hotel... its nice... has a bar... breakfast... whatever like many hotels do, towels are fresh ect. But the staff is what really sets it apart.  I recommend booking and seeing it and enjoy the stay for yourself. I worked in the hospitality industry for 9 years first working at a Marriott and then transitioning to the Four Seasons. Yeah the hotel is nice but the staff by far is what makes the stay special. These people I am about to include treated us like family, went above and beyond and truly added their personal touch. I cant even explain. It was not fake, it was not scripted.. just true genuine people. I would love to work there and be a part of their team. They deserve by far the most credit and what truly make the Limelight hotel unique. The hotel would not be the same without them. Marty very nice guy and went above and beyond for us. Assured us he will find us a room and was happy we where returning guests. Peter M. also made sure we enjoyed our stay, very nice guy to chat with and gave me advice on the drive back to California since it was snowing. Jitka who comforted my girlfriend making sure everything will be ok on our drive back and not to worry about the light snow. She also went above and beyond to make sure we will enjoy our stay. And of course upon checkout Nicholette remembered us from last year and was happy to see us again. She always has a smile and great to chat with. These 4 people are what makes the limelight hotel and I cant thank them enough. So please who ever reads this take your time and acknowledge and thank them for all the hard work they do. - Thomas L."]},

We also had to pay ahead-of-time, so there was no cancellation allowed.  High points of the Durant are its very central location, relative closeness to the ski lifts (although we were there in summer, so it was hard to tell just HOW close the hotel was to skiing), and walkable proximity to downtown Aspen.  We also walked to the Music Festival, but I personally would recommend driving because it's a bit far, an uphill walk back afterward, and there is plenty enough parking at the festival, especially when compared to the post-game auto melee at baseball stadia.  Generally speaking, parking at this hotel was easy.  Also, the Durant has recently undergone a stylish renovation.", "More on that.  We had three people in our room and I felt that the room (with two double beds) was small for that many people.  I could only imagine what it would have been like for four.  Storage was at a minimum or at best inconvenient (under the beds).  Electric outlets were hidden away and hard to reach for the typical modern appurtenances (cell phones, laptops, etc.).  In the bathroom, there was a lack of hooks for hanging things (like towels and \"dop\" kits).  When compared to other modern renovations, this one was not well enough thought out.", "That said, the hotel staff was nice and helpful.  The public areas were commodious enough for a 3-star hotel.

The bed was a little small. Everything was very clean and well-maintained. The wifi was a little spotty, but free. Also, the room was pretty dark even with the shaded open, and the windows overlooked the windows of the hotel next door, so the view was zero and the shades had to be closed for any privacy.

We were absolutely thrilled with the renovation of the hotel that just completed this past Nov/Dec. The hotel is stylish and cozy...it has a European feel to it...almost like a much more expensive boutique hotel for a lot less money. The rooms are lovely! The beds, comforters and linens are new and very comfortable. The water pressure is great in the shower...and welcome after a day of skiing. We stayed for a week and while the rooms are not extraordinarily large, they are more than adequate for the price. The owner and staff could not be nicer and more accomodating....they really made us feel welcome. The continental breakfast and afternoon cookies, wine and cheese are really a nice touch...and the coffee was great! The lobby is very pretty and a nice social gathering place in front of the fireplace. We love Colorado in the summertime, too,  and are looking forward to staying at our new favorite, affordable, and lovely hotel in Aspen."]},

I appreciate that the allocation is at the Hotels discretion, but why would we buy a room with two double beds? Simple, we had 2 adults and two small children and 1 adult planned with i child in each. The hotel was recently fully renovated and is really suited for couples, not children. The phones were like a prop on a set, not connected. The Hotel suited our needs and was comfortable et cetera with a basic free breakfast and a small spa on the deck. The only tip I would make would be to confirm the bedding configuration required and make it a condition of the booking, then ask for a confirmation to be sent to you.

Closet and drawer space was a bit tight.  Wireless internet was included for me and was fast.  As a whole, the room was a little disappointing and seemed to lack the special touches some other St. Regis or Ritz properties might have.

It's clear after having stayed at multiple St. Regis properties both in the U.S., but also internationally, that the St. Regis puts emphasis on this.  Quite a few of the employees are from abroad, which likely helps having a stable experienced team and it shows.  Everyone is super friendly, accommodating, but also very professional.  Human resources is a huge challenge in the hotel industry, but it seems St. Regis has this aspect figured out.", "Downsides - not a lot other than the rather basic room and the limited parking options.

My only warning is there is very little parking here.  The lot was full and this was the off season when the hotel wasn't even full.  Street parking is available but on weekdays, it's only for 2 hour time periods.  How are you supposed to legally park overnight?  Most people who drive to Aspen for fun from Metro Denver are in big SUVs with all their gear.  So big cars don't really mesh with a small lot.  And who wants to park far away to hoof all their gear?

On top of that, the kitchen turns out one nourishing hot meal to top it all off.  The two days we stayed, we enjoyed blueberry pancakes and scrambled eggs and bacon one morning while the second offered Denver omelets and hash browns.", "The list of free extras, from the facility\u2019s amenities, to the Wi-Fi, to the parking, both on street and in a garage below the building typically add a hefty charge to most other hotel bills even though their room rates are already many multiples of the price for a room at the Mountain Chalet.  It is easy to spend $750 a night and up, way up, at the bigger name hotels, but there is no comparison to the value received for the price at the Mountain Chalet.", "And, yes, the underground parking is tight, with a cement pillar on either one side of every pair of parking places, and it is a challenge if you have a full sized SUV, but it is covered and protects one\u2019s vehicle from the hail or other weather.  An elevator runs from the underground parking to all four floors, but there is only one, so sometimes it is a bit of a hike if your room is on the east end of the hotel, and sometimes walking through the place is a little like navigating a maze until you learn the layout.", "And, finally, the key to all real estate:  Location.  At the corner of Durant and Mill, the Mountain Chalet is a one block walk to the pedestrian malls of downtown Aspen or the metro transit hub.

The lobby area is beautifully decorated, with great art (love the horse photography) and many separate areas and rooms -- easy to find a quiet spot if you want.  Our (free upgrade) suite was likewise gorgeous--it's great when hotels move away from bland beige everywhere and have books and interesting artifacts in the rooms.  We didn't use the butler service much but the service in general was impeccable, including in the informal restaurant with its indoor/outdoor options.  There's also a lovely pool area and a very good spa.  If you have a dog or love dogs, it's dog-friendly.  Views are awesome.  Location is a block or two away from the hubbub of downtown.  It's not cheap, of course, but then nothing in Aspen is cheap (the cheapest item in the downtown sunglasses store was $400!!).  We've tried several other hotels in Aspen but this is our favorite, and we've stayed here several times.", "This is not to say that there aren't a few small quirks that could be fixed.  Here are some examples (I hope they will be useful to the management).  We didn't have great dining experiences (oy, those leaden waffles!). All the outlets along one particular wall in the suite didn't work. The phone would not let you dial outside the hotel, even though we followed the instructions that came with it.  The lighting switches will drive you bonkers -- we ended up sleeping with some lights on because no matter how many switches we messed with, we couldn't turn them off.  And the sheets smelled so strongly of detergent that they irritated my throat. Oh yes, and who wants maid service at 8.30 am on a Sunday morning? All of these are easily fixable --someone just needs to pay attention.", "I don't want to end on a negative note, so I'll say again:  in my opinion, this is the best place to stay in Aspen.

It turned out to be one of the worst meals we had in a long time.  The wine was 3X retail regardless of the vineyard or vintage, the fried chicken was far inferior than even Popeyes Chicken, and the filet minon, bland and tasteless.  If only Gordon Ramsey was there with us, it would have definitely been a show.  The kitchen staff looked bored with a few on their phones texting, the waiter was fairly arrogant, because of what I will never know.  We walked away with a $500+ dollar check and would have rather went to Otoro in Irvine, San Shi Go in Balboa Island, or Del Frisco for steak.  Overall the town was run down and depressing, not a single restaurant in all of Aspen was worth writing a review about, and worse of all, the spring skiing was cringy unless the entire day was spent up top in the black diamonds.

A horrendous plumbing noise came through the TV wall for 10 minutes, not one would expect in a 5 star hotel and not even 2 star hotels these days,  so I called the front desk and requested a change of room.  Front desk said hotel is full but offered to get an engineer to check out my problem.  I explained to engineer when he arrived after the plumbing noise stopped that the noise was likely from the adjacent room\u2019s bathroom shower plumbing.  He first denied that there was even an adjacent bathroom behind the tv wall but eventually agreed to run a test by turning on the adjacent bathroom shower.   Surely the problem was what I stated after running the test.    The plumbing was not properly insulated and the wall was not designed correctly  so noise travelled to my room in particular through the tv electrical outlet opening in the wall.", "Very fortunately, I had a room for my son and daughter in law and they switched with me.  His room of 314 was not a corner room like mine so bathroom is back to back against adjacent room and no plumbing noise problem.   However, the room had a little dog smell, we believe.  This problem may not be unique to this hotel because many hotels now are dog friendly but dogs occassionlly pee and poo on sofa or bed throw etc.   This problem might have been exaggerated by tremendous junk on the bed - thick fur bed throw, tubular pillow and a small pillow,  all for decorative purpose only.   As we all know, guests typically throw them on the floor before  turn down service, if any,  but they get put back on the newly made bed, without washing or cleaning of course.  Worst thing is that the decorative pillows here sat next to the white pillows and on top of the bed sheet that your neck and face may touch.  Most big hotel brands have eliminated this decorative design feature but St Regis Aspen is still hot and heavy on this feature.", "Another deficiency  is that the mini bar frig doesn\u2019t work.  When I called the hotel to ask an engineer to check it for me as I prefer to refrigerate my glucoma eye drops, the front desk called me back later that the mini bar is just a room temperature minibar.  What the hell that means!   I later discovered that there is no ventilation in the minibar cubicle so heat get trapped inside the cubicle so no cooling effect in the minibar frig.  I was not expecting a cold frig but surely not a unit with room temperature or may be warmer!  Again, I don\u2019t expect such deficiency in a 5 star hotel.

What it lacks in glamour and glitz, it more than makes up for in warmth and charm. A room on the front side of the property overlooks the manicured greens of Aspen's rugby field, the town and stunning mountainside background.

The lobby is quite atmospheric and kept at a lovely temperature so you feel cosy. However the lobby/bar area is too small. It was always busy, sometimes could not find a table and very noisy. Speaking of noise there were a large number of children in the hotel - guess this is a good or bad thing depending on your situation. There were also a ton of dogs (which is much more to my liking!) and the owners were saying the hotel was very dog friendly and looked after their 4 legged friends.

It was a lot smaller than I expected, I did enjoy the leather beds and the Frette bedding and robes but the room was starting to look a little tired and space was tight - the sofa was so narrow that it was uncomfortable, the bathroom had 2 basins but there was very little surface area to keep toiletries and the bath was far too small to relax in.

We understand a no refund policy however if he threw away thousands of dollars on a room it would be wonderful if they had enough customer service to at least comp a spa service or meal or even something smaller on his next trip to Aspen. The second issue I had was with the new Velvet Buck restaurant. The food is highly overpriced for the quality. It seemed very out of place for the St Regis. Other than that, the stay was great.

It\u2019s several blocks away and we were in our ski boots and carrying our skis.  Yes, we could do it and did BUT the hotel has vans and drivers to take you, but no one told us.  That evening, we decided to get a drink at the bar.  The bartender asked where we were from and then again insulted our home town!  I actually told him they they really needed to stop saying that because I found it offensive.  Our room was fine, but nothing to get excited about, on the small side and the bathroom was small as well (although lovely).  The room was very dated, not much light and decorated like my grandmother lived there.  The outdoor hot tubs did not get very hot and they want $50 per person for the indoor hot tub.  That seemed excessive as we figured we would only last 15-20 minutes.  The breakfast restaurant was great.  We did not have the buffet, but our omelets were delicious and lots of variety to choose from.  Staff outstanding.

It was so amazing last year we decided to come back. We stayed for nine nights and we loved every minute of it. The hotel was sold out for the first weekend we were there and they did not miss a beat with service. I am pretty picky and I have to say it is the staff that makes this place go from a beautiful luxury property to a magical amazing property. The concierges all of them are outstanding from Mary Pat and Julie who I love and did everything they could to make our stay so special we pretty much rebooked this year because of them. Stephanie and Jesse were also amazing at the concierge desk. It is truly because of people who work there like Lucille and Felipe and the concierge staff that we will be back every year. We also loved the service from Claudia Henri in the bar area every night. The physical property itself is immaculate, new and beautiful. It smells nice. The housekeeping staff a pleasure to see everyday as was the room service team. The valets were AWESOME...they came and picked us up when we got lost on a hiking trail one day near town and they set up the Lexus loaner car for us to go to Woody Creek Tavern...the ski team in the ski shop helped my husband every morning to get set up to hit the slopes. Seriously I have never seen a more helpful staff in a hotel. We have also visited the other nice hotels in Aspen and we would never stay anywhere else but at the St. Regis. The hotel is quiet and not on a busy road and this makes a difference. Every staff member acknowledges you and greets you at every interaction. It feels like home from the moment you check in to the moment you leave. It is so beautifully decorated for the holidays and the little touches like chocolate at turn down, scope in the bathroom and lavender bath salts, bottled water at the valet stand, champagne ceremony every day at 4:45pm, fireplaces,spa,live music in the lounge....I mean it is just fabulous. Finally I was being silly one night and I filled out the letter to Santa Box at the front desk one night and I just asked that for 2018 my wish was that santa be kind to animals. The next day we had a note from santa under our door and it said that the hotel had made a donation to an animal rescue group on our behalf. It was not just any note it had little cats and dogs all over the letter. I was in tears....I am an adult and it felt like the best Christmas gift I could have ever received since I lost my soul mate cat last year. Forever grateful to this hotel and Felipe for creating some hotel magic during what must be for this staff a very challenging time of year~~~grateful and we will be back. Heather the GM is a ROCK STAR. For many reasons I have no listed this is the BEST hotel to stay in while visiting Aspen compared to the other offerings in town. Just book it and go."]},

She came out with a huge bag of yogurt, fruit and muffins, more than enough for us all. There was coffee in a lounge area. This is where I will stay on every future Aspen trip!"]},

Located blocks away from the foot of Ajax and a short walk from shopping and Wagner Park, there's no better place to stay for the skiing and shopping.  The city's free transpo bus drops you off right at Lift One after a long day on the slopes, and you can ease your aching muscles in the recently remodeled and enlarged Jacuzzi, contemplating the beautiful mountain view through the rising steam.  The Condos themselves are welcoming and homey, usually featuring rugged Southwestern art combined with sleek modern touches.  It's wonderful for families and kids.  I've been coming here with my family since I was young, and I have great memories of group dinners and evening games in the family rooms of the condominiums.  The management is helpful and friendly.

When we visited the hotels ambiance was a relaxing quiet. During the weekend they had several hotel activities scheduled like wine tastings and smores by the fire pits; they were all free to participate. The decor was very luxurious and they were renovating so that it would look even more pristine and up to date. Our bedroom had comfortable clean beds, and had an open concept. So, we could open a sliding door from the bathroom to connect to the main room. The staff was friendly when we would make request for things like tea or for our coffee machine to be fixed or replaced; but the front office staff tended to drag on conversations with other guests about their day, while we politely waited to make a quick request for hot water to be brought up. But that really is our only complaint.

Nope. I used the fitness center once and never went back, unfortunate as I enjoy a nice workout while on vacation to burn off the inevitable excess calories consumed.

The check in counter is awkward with high monitors covering the faces of the reception clerks which made for an unwelcome interaction. The spa facility is small with a co-ed waiting area and locker rooms each with a wet room (Hot Tub and steam room) and a co-ed hot tub with a waterfall feature. The first thing I noticed in the women's facility, is that there is no where to sit down and relax, no loungers - not even in the co-ed waiting area (which felt like a doctor's office from 1975 with hard upright seating and plastic/faux-leather furniture. The wet room in the woman's locker room was small and difficult/dangerous to climb in and out of the hot tub. Why, oh why, is there no Sauna in this spa? This is a mountain lodge hotel reinstatement of a beautiful Swiss chalet..which should have a wonderful wood sauna. The best sauna experience I have had is at the Encore Hotel Spa in Las Vegas - management please install a similar sauna on your next remodel (which cannot come soon enough). I received a massage treatment which was not memorable or worth the money.I usually arrive 3 hours before my treatment to enjoy the spa facilities however, after 30 minutes I was ready to leave and retreated to my hotel room until it was time for my massage treatment when I went back down to the spa and returned promptly after. Overall very disappointing and not on par with what this hotel should offer.

In the midst of Aspen, where virtually everything is overpriced and geared to the monied traveler, Mountain Chalet provides a place with a long (60 year) history of welcoming all travelers at a very fair price.  This is not a chain hotel; it has individual and local charm. Our room was comfortable and clean, the plumbing and wifi worked well, and the free breakfasts were exceptional.  Every morning a different made-to-order hot dish, usually with eggs and a strip of perfectly cooked bacon, as well as really fresh fruit, cold cereals, hot oatmeal, toast, etc., and fresh squeezed orange juice (which you can squeeze yourself with an extraordinary machine in the dining room).  There are fresh cookies every afternoon and into the evening, and Kuerig coffee available 24 hours.  Our bed was very comfortable, with a nice quilt of just the right weight (not a lumpy duvet). The room temperature was just right, and we had a nice view which included Aspen Mountain (and the St. Regis across the street) and a small balcony overlooking the pool. It is worth reserving well in advance and asking for a room with a mountain or park view and balcony.  There's a good size outdoor swimming pool which is very well heated, and an indoor hot tub which is huge and has pretty good jets. The grounds are lovely and well-maintained with delightful flowers, and there are hand-painted chalet images on the exterior walls.  Mountain Chalet clearly welcomes children and dogs and parties.  There were some lively times while we were there, but it always calmed down by bedtime.  We had a good night sleep every night.  And there's a full service gym, which is small but well-equipped. The whole experience was an amazing throwback to the days of really good hotels that were friendly and reasonably priced. And the location is perfect for enjoying the downtown or going up Aspen Mountain. Parking is free and indoor.  If I had to criticize anything, it would be the toiletry products, which are very basic, so if soap, shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion matter to you, bring your own.

I wasn't here to ski, so the room and the resort was going to be a big part of my experience. Spoiler alert, I wasn't disappointed! A driver met us at the Aspen airport and whisked us to our wonderus St. Regis Aspen Resort surrounded by beautiful mountains. Let me get this out of the way...this place will cost you big money!!! Omg, I have never paid over $425 a night anywhere and I was getting a discount!!! A burger is $25 bucks, a martini is $20 so bring your big boy credit card! I did pay extra to have a room with a fire place. This was a mistake! It got too hot and you could not have it on for more then 5 minute before you started to cook! To be fair, Aspen wasn't very cool when I stayed even though there was snow on the ground. My room was amazing! I had a view of the front of the Hotel and the tops of the high mountain. Every luxury was right there at my finger tips. Mini bar, expresso machine, a wonderful bed, and a wooden desk so I could get some work done. There really is to many fabulous experiences to list here, so I'll just try to run thought some highlights. Fantastic gym, late night hot tub, outdoor fire pits with mountain views, s'mores! Staff knows your name, beautiful lobby with fireplace and bar. A manager held a flash light over the menu for me when I had a late supper. It was Christmas time, they had a beautiful tree and a Christmas room! Aspen is not a large town, so you can walk anywhere from this resort. I just can't say enough about the St. Regis Aspen.

But the most enjoyable part of our stay was meeting folks around the breakfast table-we made fast friends with a couple from Denver, a family, whose daughter is studying all summer at the Aspen Music School, a couple  who were on an Art seeking tour for their galleries in  London, a couple from Kansas on a delayed honeymoon trip, and a trio of young neurologists from Belgium who were attending a medical seminar that week,  Then there was the innkeeper \" M\" who is delightful and so full of energy.  David was also on the property to keep it in fine shape.  We cannot wait to go back."]},

Along with that is a buffet with fruits, home made granola, yogurt, coffee, cereal, etc.  What could be better?  A fresh squeezed OJ machine (like at Whole Foods!) included with breakfast.

We wanted to be near everything, but not spend an arm and a leg and we got just that at Hotel Durant. It is a charming boutique hotel with clean modern d\u00e9cor - kind of a Scandinavian style. Check in and check out was fast and easy and we got a map of the area with a couple restaurant recommendations. They offer a free continental breakfast every morning and warm cookies in the evening in their cozy dining/living room areas on the first floor. They even had a nice fireplace with plenty of seating. We did not have a car since we ubered from the airport nearby and then either walked around town or if we went skiing we took the free bus at the bus station only a few minutes by foot. We later realized we could have also just taken the free bus to and from the airport so we did that when we departed. So you really don't need a car unless you are not flying into the Aspen airport. The downtown is a good size and you can get around the whole thing by foot and not get tired. There are  a lot of restaurants, bars, hotels, and of course high end shopping so bring some money to spend. The room itself was comfortable, clean, and stylish. And again the price was great considering it's Aspen! It was a lot less than other hotels that were nice and/or the same as others that were old and ugly. We would definitely stay here again!"]},

We usually stay at the Gant but were unable to stay since we were traveling with our dog. The Alps was a great choice for us as some units accept pets and the price was much better than staying at nearby hotels--a small fortune for a family of 5 and a dog. Plus we love having a condo, cooking breakfast and privacy. I was disappointed that we were only given a \"standard room\" option when booking because we had a pet. My fears of a very outdated unit were realized when we entered. When booking it was clear that we could either get lucky or not. While the unit had some cool vintage padded leather counter stools which were probably mid-century, they would have been cooler had the decor been somewhat updated. The carpet was something you'd see in a garage or your grandpas basement--a thin Olivey-pea green industrial type. Silky green bedspreads and decorative pillows with unidentified spots in our master which were exchanged after I pointed it out to the helpful cleaning staff. The couch was an L shape baby blue/pink/green Aztec print circa 1983. It actually turned out to be insanely comfy. Again--maybe the furniture would work if the floors and kitchen were updated. The kitchen had a very finicky old push button dishwasher and shell colored countertops to match the walls. I called right away to ask for a different unit. John was incredibly nice, searching for a different option. He said he wanted us to be happy, always a nice thing to hear! There were no options available except for a more expensive option in a town home, more than we needed and at the bottom of the hill. We actually LOVED being up high on the hill btw. I told him we would stay in our unit. I opened all the blinds to the double high windows, realizing the gorgeous view of gondolas passing overhead, up the steep green mountain. Gorgeous! Beautiful view front and back of our unit and long balconies. At the end of our driveway were trails heading straight up--we are active and loved waking up and heading up to defray all of the amazing food we inhaled every day. We didn't mind the short hike down to town-1-3 minutes. We actually took the straight route down the ski hill. ", "The staff was so friendly at the Aspen Alps. Incredibly responsive, helpful and never pretentious. We loved the associate which would run up ice for us (ice maker didn't work on old but nice sub zero). Beside the soiled bedding the rest of our unit was cleaned beautifully--we loved our housekeepers who straightened our things and set up our kids stuffed animals just so on their pillows. We also asked a front desk associate to borrow a pillow for one of our kids for the long trip home. She obliged kindly and the pillow will be on its way back soon. The two extra bedrooms were decorated nicely and had in my opinion better bedding than the master. Although the bathrooms were not updated they were so nicely maintained and good quality I didn't mind.", "The small bummer was after staying a few days I was tracked down outside by an associate asking about our dog. They said they didn't know about our dog (I had spent a lot of time on the phone initially with John, and finally booked with him on the entire premise we were travelling with our dog--he said we were limited on room selection, etc.. And we had to book \"standard\") which was so strange as we were in our unit because months earlier I made my reservation specifically for a pet friendly property. What obviously had happened was our bill had been reviewed by a tenacious employee and after paying thousands for our room it was discovered we had not been charged our \"pet cleaning fee\".  I was a little taken back as we were as transparent as humanly possible about our dog; he was even standing next to me at check in!! The employee even mentioned that she saw no proof of us mentioning our dog in prior emails that she must have looked for. Well--probably because we booked on the phone?? With the manager! Anyhow--a better approach is \"I'm sorry we missed this--we forgot to charge a pet fee\".  I mentioned I understood--but that our unit was below our expectations. I asked if she could wave the pet fee (esp after adding an extra night to our 5th as tourist season is slowing down) and she said after we checked out she would get back to me. I told her I was fine with that. We haven't heard back as we left two days ago. ", "Despite that small hiccup we truly loved our stay at Aspen Alps!! I would recommend better warning for pet owners re standard room and some sort of incentive for upgraded unit owners to accept well behaved pets. ", "We would love to return to Aspen Alps!! "]},

You couldn't cook a roast, but then who wants to when in Aspen. The management and staff are very helpful. Late check in is via an envelope with a key left for you. It's warm, it's comfortable and unless you're looking for the full service 5* experience, you can't beat this place. If you like a little independence, a home from home with your own front door, then the Prospector is for you. There were 3 of us in our party and as we were family members it worked fine with a separate bedroom and Murphy bed in the foyer area. Thera are 2 separate bathrooms. It probably would not work so well for 2 couples because the Murphy bed area does not offer much privacy, but for families, it's perfect. There is a wood burning stove, a place outside each unit for ski storage, but I don't know how safe this would be because you are not able to secure these from public access. Overall 8/10. Would not hesitate to stay there again and recommend to others."]},

", "4) DRIVERS: some drivers were friendly, prompt and was joyful to ride with.  some drivers were not pleasant at all.  depending on who you ride with, service would be different.  worse yet, we had to wait 35 minute to get a return ride back from our dinner at matsuhisa.  front desk informed us that driver will be there in 15 minute.  he didn't show until 40 minute later.  it would have been nice if the front desk informed us that it would take 40 minute up front so that i don't have to look for the driver for 25 extra minute. i had to go out on a snowy cold weather 2 separate times to look for the driver if he has parked nearby and was waiting on us.", "4) ELEMENT 47 ; their breakfast is nothing out of the ordinary and was not impressive.  but their biggest disappointment was the dinner.  we enjoy michelin 3 star restaurants to your fast food depending on the occassion.  but this dining was the worse we had.  we ordered wagu beef (their signature dish) and my wife had risotto and our teenager had the pasta.  wagu beef came a bit salty and i enjoy full flavored steak so i nevertheless ended up finishing the dish.  however, the risotto and the pasta was the worst.  it was so salty, we couldn't eat it.  i wanted to return the dish and make a complain but my wife stopped me as she already lost all her appetite and wanted to just go to the room to rest.  ", "4) BAR : my wife ordered a cocktail and she is 41.  hostess asked for an id (at first, it was funny)  but when she did not serve her because she did not have id with her, it was not funny at all..  she was not flexible and she found no way to help her get served.  i am 50 and my wife is 41, i can understand that this is the law but to be this inflexible to a guest who is staying in your hotel is bad service and unaccommodating.

The unit was comfortable, kitchen was nicely laid out and had all we needed to make breakfast and a couple of evening meals.  Only one complaint, and that's the breakfast bar, which was the only place to eat unless sitting on the couch and eating from the coffee table, was chest high on me, and I had a difficult time climbing onto the bar chairs, so eating at the breakfast bar was difficult.  I'm 5'2\", so it might not have been the challenge for tall people.  However, the breakfast bar and chairs LOOK really sharp! Just not comfortable for me.  I cannot say enough good things about Andrew and Tim who were at the front desk - they provided shuttle service for us to go many places in town, and offered suggestions on good restaurants.  Parking is indeed limited behind the resort, but on-street parking may be available with a lot of searching, and does require a permit from the resort.  Our unit's back door opened onto the parking lot so unloading and loading the car was very easy.  My suggestion is, if you find a place to park, stay there and ask for rides on the shuttle.

Please note the number of bedrooms you get for the price.    We only needed one and got two.", "Cons", "What this ad does not tell you is that this property is made up of private condominiums.   Frias is the management company.   Their office is across the street.", "You may have noticed that their ad for this property does not include a telephone number.  It only includes a fax number.

The late check in policy is not posted anywhere on this or any other ad for the property.

When my wife and I arrived have a long drive from Estes Park at 11:30 PM, the so called hotel address was the Frias - Aspen property office across the street.    We received no email from Frias telling us about the late arrival policy and procedures.     We initially thought that we had been tricked in an online scheme.  Look for yourself, the Chateau\u2019s by Frias ad is very vague.     But, eventually, after another hotel manager called the late night Frias number, we were able to figure out the late arrival check in procedures.      Once we were able to check in, we were happy with the accommodations.     I stopped by the Frias office and told them that they need to be more transparent with this property including the ads for folks like us who had not been to Aspen before.   They seem to discount our concerns and blamed Travelocity for the misunderstanding, which I found to be very week.   I advised them to be transparent with their customers that 1) this is a private condo with no hotel lobby, and 2) advise customers on the late arrival policy and facilitate communication with their customers prior to arrival.", "Overall, we had a good time in Aspen.     The bed at our particular condo was very comfortable.   However, Frias needs to do a better job with regard to the Chateaus by Frias property in conveying transparency on exactly what customers are getting when they book this property.   THEY ALSO MUST IMPROVE COMMUNICATION WITH THOSE CUSTOMERS THAT   BOOK THIS PROPERTY VIA EMAIL, SOCIAL MEDIA, AND OUR TELEPHONE.  THEY SEEM TO TAKE THEIR CUSTOMERS FOR GRANTED WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROPERTY, AND THAT IS NEVER GOOD.     THEY NEED TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT THAT THIS  IS INDEED NOT A HOTE BUT A CONDO COMPLEX MANAGED BY FRIAS.  THEY NEED TO CLEARLY STATE THIS IN ANY MARKETING MATERIALS THAT THEY PUBLISH OR THROUGH ANY OUTSOURCED MARKETING CHANNELS SUCH AS TRAVELOCITY.

When we arrived in Colorado, we stayed 1 night in Denver before driving to Aspen. We arrived earlier than typical check-in time, but the gentleman who was at the front desk was kind enough to let us check in early! We realized after he introduced himself that he was the manager on duty for the week we'd be staying. Gus was super accommodating and friendly- he helped us bring our bags to our room and gave us his personal cell number in case we needed to get in touch with him. Gus gave us numerous suggestions for things to do in the area, favorite Aspen restaurants, and more! He was very knowledgeable about the area and even gave us a brief history lesson on the beautiful Independence Square. We were lucky enough to stay on the 3rd floor in one of the rooms facing the town square. One of the photographs on the wall was a shot of the front of the very same building more than a century ago! The Independence Square is located very conveniently to shops, parks, bars, and restaurants. While we did not use the rooftop hot tub, we did spend lots of time taking in the breath-taking views of this picture-perfect town and mountains! Our room was beautifully decorated, as was the rest of the common areas of the hotel (foyer, dining room, common areas on each floor, etc.), and our kitchen and bathroom were in pristine condition, clearly having just been cleaned.  Our linens were fresh and our kitchen came stocked with a bottle opener, plates, wine glasses, and some kitchen tools. Gus invited us to make ourselves at home, pointing out a bookshelf full of novels and board games that the guests are encouraged to borrow.  I am direction-challenged, and one afternoon I went for a walk and found myself totally turned around and lost. Instead of asking a passerby for directions, I called Gus on his cell and he was patient enough to walk me through the directions until I recognized where I was. Not only was our vacation made by our exquisite accommodations, but also by the kindness and helpfulness of The Independence Square's manager, Gus.

Our room had 2 king size beds and a complimentary mini bar that was stocked daily with sodas, water, and juices of various types. On the food side of the mini bar there were bags of chips, Oreo cookie packs, various protein bars, etc. Mixed in with the food was a tall thin canister of oxygen. THIS is NOT free so don't be fooled. There is a $40 charge for this so be warned now! It probably should NOT have been placed in with all the free things. We don't drink so we didn't even notice the brochure outlining the cost of everything that was tucked behind the liquor. We did have to ask for the mini bar to be restocked once because this is something completely separate from the maid service. The rooms have hairdryers, umbrellas, a mini sewing kit, slippers, robes, and an iron with an ironing board. IF you are traveling there on a budget (most were not), then taking things like sodas and chips with you for the day can help save some money. TRY to get a room that is NOT street side! The guests in the hotel are quiet but traffic starts very early and ends very late each day, making it quite noisy.

I'm not sure that a larger person could comfortably maneuver around in there. We would stay again but take the gamble on a different room if given the option. "]},

Alas, we decided to take the plunge and see what the fuss was all about. Let's just say, we weren't disappointed. ", "The hotel appeared to encompass an entire block and was right in the midst of the slopes. Unfortunately as a beginner, I skied at nearby Buttermilk instead. Although my boyfriend had the pleasure of skiing here everyday and he absolutely loved it! ", "We\u2019ve landed ourselves a spacious one-bedroom suite with a balcony on the second floor overlooking the heated pool, Chair 9 restaurant/bar, and the mountains beyond. While we would\u2019ve preferred a much more quieter location, it definitely provided much amusing people-watching during the raucous apres-ski scene. One thing that surprised us was how elegant and classy of a hotel The Little Nell appeared to be, until the apres ski scene rolled around. Quite the contrast. Next thing you know, you\u2019re wondering if you\u2019re even staying in the same hotel. It was always crowded everyday, perhaps it was because we were there over the weekend, and music was blasting. I didn\u2019t think the DJ was anywhere as good, but hey, if you\u2019re into this sort of scene, I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t mind as much. Everyone appeared to be having a good time...and drunk, might I add.", "Our room was absolutely beautiful. We loved the chalet-inspired modern feel to it. We had two fireplaces, spacious dining and living areas, two bathrooms and the main was equipped with a steam shower, elegant bar/kitchen with the most exquisite wine program offered, ample closet space, both hardwood and carpeted flooring. Their wine program offered in the mini fridge and on the kitchen counter were something else! I\u2019m a wine lover and had never been to a hotel where they provided expensive bottles of wine right in the comfort of your room. Normally, you would have to request for it through in-room dining or at the bar. Of course these exquisite wines were not free, and they weren\u2019t cheap either. Some of them had a hefty price tag. I made sure not to \u201caccidentally\u201d touch a $600+ bottle of wine. But what The Little Nell did offer generously were the amazing collection of complimentary soft drinks and snacks. For the price we\u2019ve paid for the suite, we thought it was a nice little touch. ", "One of the nights we were there, the well-renowned chef, Jean Georges and his son, Cedric, hosted a dinner event at The Little Nell\u2019s restaurant called Element 47. As, or rather was, a fan of Jean Georges in NYC - we couldn\u2019t miss this opportunity. It was a prix-fixe menu with multiple courses. Of course we didn\u2019t think the chefs were really cooking for all the patrons dining that night, because they were too busy making rounds greeting tables. Ha. Perhaps they've crafted the menu and it was executed by the cooks from Element 47. While it was a pleasant meal, it wasn\u2019t anything to write home about. Meeting Jean Georges was underwhelming. He definitely spent time schmoozing with the bigger tables and barely greeted us patrons in tables of twos. When he finally came to greet our table, he barely acknowledged us and continued on his way to the next table. WTF? So much for that experience! After this, I didn\u2019t have any qualms his flagship restaurant got dropped down to two Michelin stars. If that was how he greeted people willing to pay their hard-earned money to sample his finest cooking, I\u2019d say he deserved it. We\u2019ll be taking our business elsewhere. ", "As for service, I thought the best received was from our waitress at Element 47 that night. She was on point, friendly and courteous. Despite how crowded this event was, she still made her rounds without breaking a sweat. In addition, I thought the woman working at the hotel boutique and an in-rooming dining employee bringing up breakfast were extremely pleasant and friendly to interact with. They deserved a proper shout-out too. ", "Service elsewhere - I didn\u2019t think one of the women working at the front desk was friendly at all. Would it hurt you to be less snooty? You could look up and smile for once. Also, acknowledging one person and not the other in a group wasn't proper. Neither was the valet anything to write home about. They weren\u2019t friendly too in my opinion. Something has to be done about the staff training here. Inconsistent service does not make a five-star hotel. Period.", "As for the shopping in the vicinity, oh my goodness! I absolutely adored the shops loitering the fine streets of Aspen with views of the mountains over yonder. High-end designer labels mixed in with pop-up concept stores, luxury consignment shops, and one-of-a-kind boutiques. I definitely did more damage here than compared to a similar ski resort town like Courchevel 1850, or even NYC for that matter. I loved how walkable The Little Nell was to all these shops. The town was not big at all that you need a car to explore. ", "All in all, I wouldn\u2019t mind visiting this hotel again to experience more of what it had to offer. Please do me a favor though, Little Nell, train your staff to be a tad less snooty, will ya? I hate to see such a beautiful hotel go downhill because of this."]},

The rooms are really spacious and for 2 adults and 2 teenaged girls - that was not a problem.  Special mention though definitely goes to the guys at Ski Concierge!  Steve was the best, friendly and looked after us so well!  These guys definitely add value to your stay.  We stay here really because the location is brilliant.  The ski concierge are located just at the bottom of Ajax at the gondola, so you basically ski down and they race out and grab your skis etc and ask if you're going back out, do they need to organise your skis for another mountain, or are you finished for the day.  You take your boots off right there and they give you your shoes.  I usually grab a coffee and a freshly baked cookie and then go next door to ajax tavern for a Rose and a salad!  So so easy!

I couldn\u2019t sleep at night, and as soon as I left in the morning for the day, I immediately felt better. Also the noise was an issue from the room above. The guests in the room above mine would walk across their room and it sounded like a herd of elephants pacing.  This was everyday starting around 5 am and would last for a couple of hours. I wondered at one point if the ceiling would fall in it was so loud! I can only attribute this to the hotel being old, but still it was ridiculous.

The only other lodge near the first mountain lift at Highlands was booked up and they referred us to the folks across the road at Heatherbed. I had never seen Heatherbed because it is hidden from the road. And from all the literature I had rifled through about Aspen in the late 1980's I cannot recall seeing one ad or advertisement about the Heatherbed Lodge.", "My wife and I worked very hard every year to be able to afford one big trip out west during the winter. We were not poor, but when you have to make every penny and every hour count we wanted accommodations that were nice, as close to ski-in, ski-out as possible, but not overly priced. We finally found that at Heatherbed! Not liking big crowds and multi level style lodging that looks like over cramped apartment condos with a community hot tub Heatherbed Lodge supplied everything we wanted to a tee! Although you have to walk across Maroon Creek Road and through the parking lot to Aspen Highlands Mountain it only takes less than five minutes to make the trek. At the end of the day's skiing, if there is plenty of snow, and you plan your route just right, you can zip right down to the steps leading down to the lodge. That was always fun, and at times rather adventurous!", "Never needed a car or jeep or SUV. Aspen's transportation system buses pick you up and let you out about 100 feet from the door of Heatherbed. Want to ski at Ajax, Buttermilk, or Snowmass? No problem. Getting there and back are easy as pie. Want a fun night out on the town to do some shopping, sight seeing and restauranting? No problem. The Aspen Skiing Company transportation is the best and they serve Heatherbed Lodge and Aspen Highlands Mountain on a regular basis.", "And then there's the intimate little hot tub just outside your room door at the lodge. No matter what time of year I was there the tub was mostly private even if the lodge was full of guests. I never figured out why that was. I guess the other guests respected everyone's privacy because they wanted the same thing. I know we did.", "The complimentary breakfasts were great, and plentiful! And the best thing about it was the serving time was not limited so that you had to rush every morning to get there before they closed. I always found the staff overly friendly and ready to help at a moment's notice. The room we stayed in was the \"Big\" one where the previous owners lived. It was absolutely spacious and comfortable. One year we had five people in our party and there was plenty of room for everyone with a large kitchen complete with utensils, dishes, a stove-oven and big refrigerator.", "Overall I stayed there with my wife at least six times choosing Aspen mountains for skiing and Healtherbed Lodge over all the other ones we had skied and stayed at in the west. Unfortunately my wife by a second marriage died at an early age so 2001 was our last visit together at Heatherbed. Two years later after all those great memories I was finally able to put my sadness aside and took my two boys by my first marriage skiing with me. They had skied with my wife and I before but we could never arrange any longer than a weekend trip with them because of their school time and other activities. So this was their first big trip to a major ski resort. When I called the folks at Heatherbed Lodge they immediately remembered me and asked where I had been the previous year. After explaining about losing my wife and telling them I was looking for accommodations in the middle of February, their busiest time, but had not been able to book the necessary months ahead of time, one of the managers got on the telephone and cleared a week in February for me and my boys. I don't know how she managed it, but we stayed in the same \"Big\" room and were treated royally once again.

The highway is two-lane and up quite a ways from the campground.  The weather was unusually warm since this elevation is only around 7500 feet.  When we arrived we went directly to City Market in Aspen to purchase firewood.  It was $5/bundle.  The firewood at camp was $7/bundle and the bundles were bigger.  So, easier in my opinion to just purchase it at the campground from the hosts.  Highlights of our stay:  Wooded and secluded sites for the most part.  Didn't feel like others were too close by.  Easy access to trail that leads to Aspen.  We walked this one morning and it took us about 1.5 hours (4.5 mile trail).   The Ice Caves - about a 15 - 20 minute drive up the pass from the campground.  You have to be quite agile to lower yourself over the rocks into the caves, but once you get there, it is amazing.  Very amazing water fall in area as well.  An easy hike to both from parking lot.  Good place for a picnic lunch.  Very clean, easily accessible toilets with toilet paper.  Bring hand sanitizer; not provided.  Water available right by the toilets.  A short walk from Site 21.  Maroon Bells:  For free access arrive before 8am or after 5pm, otherwise you need to take a shuttle from bottom of hill which is $8/person + $5 to park car.

And a bear box is not a bad sign - it's a sign you are camping in the mountains where wildlife is present.  We never saw bear but posters around the site said there had been bear activity in May and June - probably from people who don't think they need to put their stuff in a bear box.  I won't go into big detail about what should be put in a bear box and why it's important but, as far as I'm concerned, having a bear box to put stuff in is a GOOD thing!", "After setting up camp we walked around a bit and yes, the sites are different sizes so I wish they could offer better descriptions on the website to help folks make a better choice for their particular needs.  www.recreation.gov is where you can see the campsite map and a small description of each site.  We did not have a reservation so after a few rounds of each loop we decided on Site 15 due to how far back it sat from the camp road.  I would say this particular site could easily accommodate 2 tents and even a 3rd if it was a smaller size.  This was a great site with HUGE boulders and lots of trees for privacy.  There are also a couple of small ropes already tied up between some trees left by previous campers for your use.  ", "There were campers in Site 13 next door but we rarely heard them and could barely see them (see my pictures) and we couldn't see anything on the other side of the site because the trees and growth are so thick.  It's right across from the water station and a very easy walk to the toilets which are next door to the water (which were very clean during our stay and did not smell).  The only drawback of this site is that since it's on the Independence Pass side there is a little bit of road noise at night of people who are hopefully only driving to their campsite further down the road and not going over the pass at night!  Yikes, it's challenging enough during the daytime!  After the traffic stopped we could hear the river every night even being as far away from it as we were on the other side of the campground.", "Since our stay was during the weekdays the camp was not very crowded, very quiet at night and had lots of empty spaces.  Everyone was friendly and we even shared some wine and snacks with another couple one night who were camping on the riverside loop. I never looked at their campsite number but from looking at the map they were either in 37 or 39 and the space was huge.  It could probably handle at least 2 tents and maybe a 3rd.  I'm not sure if any of those spaces are actually right by the water though.  We took the small hike on the path by the river and had to climb a trail UP to get back to the campground so I don't think they back up to the water like you might think they would.", "Another reviewer mentioned showering at the Aspen Rec Center so we also took advantage of their facilities when we went into town.  $6.50 per person gets you into the locker room (or 5.60 twilight rate during the last 90 minutes of operation allows access to the whole center) - bring your own towel and toiletries and a small lock wouldn't be bad if you want to secure your things in a locker while you're in the shower.  Also if you have a toiletries bag with a hook or suction cup on it that would work best for the shower stalls they have.  It's a really nice rec center and the employees are friendly to campers.", "For hours and rates see http://www.aspenrecreation.com/aspen-recreation-centers/aspen-recreation-center/   ", "A few other random thoughts:  Bugs were not a problem for us but I had plenty of Off! spray which may have taken care of any pests wanting to invade our space.  There are trash dumpsters at the campground entrance so you don't have to take it with you.  There's no electricity here and no cell signal so plan accordingly to charge your gadgets and communicate while you're in town or in the car with chargers.  The camp sells bundles of firewood for 6.00 or you can also buy it at City Market in town.  Picnic tables at some sites are fixed and others are able to be moved around a small distance although secured to the ground with a buried cable.  This made a difference to us the one night it rained so we could scoot the table near some trees and hang up our tarp.  The Group Site they have here is ENORMOUS so if you have a big group definitely try to reserve that one - it's a bit secluded from the rest of the camp with its own toilets.  The spacing of the water stations and toilets seemed to be convenient to all the camping sites so no matter which site you picked you'd never be too far walking to get to either one.", "We really enjoyed our stay at Difficult.  As I said to the host driving around in her golf cart taking care of stuff, the only difficult aspect of the campground is deciding which site to pick!  We prefer a campsite with lots of trees and growth and the more \"woodsy\" feel and Difficult delivers!  On our way to Maroon Bells we saw all the \"Silver\" campsites and even drove through Silver Queen to see what people were raving about.  The mountain views are fantastic but for me the sites are too open to each other without any kind of space or privacy between them but to each their own.  We hope to camp again at Difficult when taking in the sites of Aspen and Maroon Bells!  I hope this review is helpful since it was all the other good reviews on Trip Advisor that persuaded us to stay here."]},

Good breakfast, nice apre' ski on Saturday afternoon, friendly helpful staff, ski lockers, bathrobes, etc.  But none of this matters if you aren't comfortable in your room.

The room was extremely small, room enough for a queen bed, a small desk, and a small cabinet.  The bed was comfy but made a lot of noise... solved by putting a washcloth behind the headboard. The closet was the size of a broom closet, and the clothes hangers were so low to the floor all our stuff touched the carpet, and there was barely enough room to hang a few winter coats, let alone your wet ski clothes.  There were no night stands next to the beds, and the coffee maker was in the closet, but no power there... you had to put it on the floor next to the bed to make coffee.  There was so little room we had to leave most of our stuff in our car or we wouldn't have any room to walk around.  The bathroom was almost as big as the bedroom, but most of the space was wasted.  The sink was free standing with little counter top, the toilet had no lid, and there was a lot of space next to the tub where they could have put another closet, but didn't... we used it to store our luggage.

All sites are pull-up with tent space, metal picnic table, fire pit with grill plate. It is located on hwy 82, 4 miles from Weller Lake campground if you're heading towards Aspen town. Where there are aspen trees around, our site didn't have much. Sites are average-sized, with privacy from neighboring sites. It is near the Roaring Fork River, just a little hike from our site which had a walking trail that lead to it. It is bear country so they advise that you store your food/coolers in the bear boxes they provide. We never came across any bears though. Drive into Aspen on 82 is about 3 miles or 10 minutes. There is a City Market right as you get into town if you ever need to get food, etc. We drove to see other campgrounds on the other side of Aspen by Maroon Bells. We really liked Silver Queen campground which is the closest to the Maroon Bells trail. The best site there is #2 or #6 -- 6 is first come first serve however; all others were reservation. There are other campgrounds below silver queen -- silver bell and silver bar. Keep in mind all  3 of these are small, unlike Difficult which has many sites. When we go back to Aspen, we'll definitely stay at Silver Queen. The view is so much more pleasing. By staying at the Silver campgrounds, you don't have to pay to take a bus to the Maroon Bells parking lot. (which is required now). You can just drive up there and park. There were no issues with Difficult except that it isn't as pretty as the campgrounds on the other side of Aspen. We really enjoyed walking around downtown Aspen. We recommend doing the short easy hike to the grotto ice caves. We did Weller Lake hike which was short and easy but big many boulders bordering the shore of the lake do not allow you to get close to the water-- it's a small lake anyhow. Weller Lake campground is right off of 82 with nothing but aspen trees. Only 11 sites- FCFS - I thought it'd be too noisy right off of the highway and not too much privacy.

There are bear-proof food lockers just in case. We camped in tents but others had pop up campers as well. There are grills on the fire pits, which we used after our portable stove started acting up.

One day we were stuck at Aspen highlands waiting for the hotel shuttle which arrived but filled up before we could get on board. However, the hotel organized for a vehicle to come pick us up, and we ended up waiting another 25 minutes - a little frustrating at the time but in the big scheme of things not such a huge deal but something to be aware of when planning your trip home after a big day of skiing. The lounge area, which is a beautiful place to sit and unwind after a day of skiing and has a large fireplace, often became full very quickly and was hard to find a space to sit- ok if you are there before 3:30pm- hard to find somewhere to sit after 4pm.", "Overall I would say this is a fabulous place to stay while in Aspen - not cheap but then nothing in aspen is and really is hard to fault.

I just popped in again for a ski trip last week and David is friendly as always, and as usual, I had booked a top floor room. Each of the top floor rooms have a two Queen beds and a separate twin bed, as well as a kitchenette. Each of the top floor rooms have these cool looking fireplaces that I've used for years, but sadly, the owners have decided to disable them. In place of a nice burning and super cozy fire log is a cheap looking electric \"fireplace\" that glows at the switch of a button, and even worse...starts \"crackling\" at the switch of another button.  UGH!!", "However, each room has a fully stocked kitchenette (pots/pans, cutlery, glassware) microwave, fridge and coffeemaker. Perfect for stocking up and cooking meals during the week, or breakfast in the morning to save money. (HINT: Stock up on groceries in Glenwood Springs at Safeway, before you come to Aspen, since groceries here are expensive)  Each room also has been upgraded, newer sheets and bed coverings as well as improved bathroom details and a big new flatscreen TV!!  My only pet peeve (other than the fireplace) is the window blinds, which are white paper type blinds which are really privacy blinds. Otherwise, the full force of the sun will quickly bring daylight into your room. Dark sleeping blinds would be great, if you want to sleep in or take an afternoon nap before heading out in the evening. If you want a pool or jacuzzi, or other hotel facilities, this place is not for you. If you want a clean and cozy place to rest between skiing or summer activities, then this hotel is for you. There is a bus stop right outside the hotel to take you to other ski areas, and the Ajax gondola is only a 15 minute walk away.

We had a \"garden\" level room which meant our room was dark.  The rooms are a bit stodgy and outdated.  Sounds like I didn't like it right?  Well, you'd be wrong.  Somehow this lodge still captures an old time feeling that I'm guessing Aspen used to have.  The vintage posters on the walls, the antique ski equipment as art, and the fact that the family that built it still runs the place makes this a great place to stay in Aspen.  The family is reknown for the skiing skllls (or so our climbing guides told us).  There is even a giant sculpture (a little odd on top of a half timber lodge) on top of the place that the founder created.  I also liked that even though they could charge a lot for a room and potentially not keep the place up all that much because of their location, they are renovating all the bathrooms.   Our brand new bathroom was really nice in southwestern colors with tile, granite, and wood.   The room was very clean and quiet.  The location is just a little outside of the main town area (easy walking distance).   We really enjoyed our stay."]},

We were quite pleased with what we had -- the standard rate of $135/night gets you a 2nd floor room, astonishingly spacious after years of cramped big-city digs, big clean bathroom with plenty of hot water and a frighteningly powerful flush mechanism, two full sized beds and one twin bed (though additional guests bring a modest extra charge), a kitchenette with some diningware and utensils, an electric stove with an oven(!) and a bar-sized refrigerator (which opens the possibility of saving some money on dining out), free WiFi, a TV with a generous selection of channels and very nice, helpful staff.  The location was an easy walk to anything in downtown Aspen, and just a couple of blocks from the Music Tent and the Aspen Summer Music Festival, so it couldn't be beat for convenience.", "Downsides?  The view from the 2nd floor room is not particularly stunning (for an extra $15/night, you might do better on the 3rd floor).  There is no ventilation in the bathroom, short of opening a window.  I didn't see an air conditioning system either, and the room got awfully stuffy with the windows closed; the window had to be left open with the ceiling fan left on to make it comfortable at night.  This, in turn created its own problems, as Main Street is one of the few fairly heavily trafficked streets in Aspen, so car noise is the price of cool comfort.", "So, it's a less than perfect place (I'd give it 3 1/2 stars if that was an option).

We didn\u2019t need the car rental as they have a Mercedes to drive you around when needed. The service here was top notch with the exception of the lounge living room area.

Another 15 mins went by and no one had followed up on what we wanted to order. I went to the front desk and complained to the manager who then said the living room service didn\u2019t start until 2pm. I explained that other guests right across from us were being served. 10 mins later we were served. No apologies, nothing. We had our 4 month old baby with us so we really didn\u2019t have 45 mins to sit around waiting to be served. I would have expected the manager did something for us like compted our drinks or something for waistline so much of our time but nothing. We had to take our food to our room because we didn\u2019t have anymore like to waste with a sleepy baby. Another time I had asked a waitress about teas while sitting in the living room area. I specially asked her for a black tea and she offered me an awake tea which she said would be a plain black tea - it ended up being a mint tea... not what I ordered and at $4 I believe for tea, which is about $6 Canadian, I should get exactly what I had wanted.

My visit last March, 2016, for 4 nights was a horrible experience. The room was excessively dirty - filthy. My friend and I both had breathing problems the entire time - not from altitude but from smells, dust, something foul in the air. The air system would not blow in cooler air so the room was unbearably hot and the street noise was unbearable with the window open at night. When I finally looked under the bed while packing to leave I was stunned at the amount of dirt, dust and ANIMAL HAIR that had accumulated there, obviously for a very long time.  Explains the breathing problems. They are a pet friendly hotel.  Pet friendly and filthy. The quality of their rooms has dropped to very poor, even for Aspen on a budget ($325+ a night budget).  I complained and was offered a free night within the next year.  A free night on your next visit is a not a solution to serious problems one has in a hotel.

My husband is handicapped with some mobility, and the reservationist had us set up in a perfect room, which was right off the pool, near the lobby, and could accommodate our three dogs. When the lock on the door was having repeated issues, the staff upgraded our room in order to accommodate my husband's needs and got him in the closest room they could, while still allowing our dogs to stay. If you are looking for a fully accessible room or have more limited ability and additional needs, make sure you ask if the accommodations will work for your needs. This was a great option for us but definitely ask questions if you have specific in room needs. The staff was incredibly friendly, the room was absolutely beautiful, the bed was comfortable, breakfast was outstanding, and the hotel itself was just plain comfortable and relaxing. While we didn't use the hot tub and pool outside, they were clean and well utilized by other guests. In spite of being right next to the pool, we had no issues with noise. The jacuzzi tub in our room worked great and was very relaxing after a day of getting around town.The hotel is also in a perfect location. My husband uses a scooter to get around and we were able to walk/roll right down main street to shopping, sight seeing, dinner, and to take the dogs down the Rio Grande Path. I was also able to walk the dogs to the ski mountain for a hike and Sunnyside trail was a short seven minute drive away. Truly, this was an outstanding hotel and fit our needs perfectly!"]},

Now to the hotel....to start, it is true what I read in other reviews--parking is very limited. We were unable to find parking in front of the hotel or in the alley, so we had to park in the neighborhood behind the hotel. We were on a two week vacation (thankfully only one night here) with our family of four so we had quite a bit of luggage. I think it would be very helpful to have one spot reserved for unloading luggage with a short time limit so we wouldn't have to drag all of our luggage through a neighborhood street.  The hotel room itself looked dingy. The caulk looked liked it needed to be redone in the bathroom--there were several spots that looked black and mildewy. The carpet looked filthy, the furnishings were outdated and the air in the room wasn't pleasant. I suppose I should be happy that we got free breakfast, but honestly, I didn't find much appetizing. The eggs tasted off, the fruit looked as though it was frozen and thawed, I saw them heating up the frozen, packaged pancakes in the microwave, 'fresh' waffles were cold and in the display case with breads and bagels...  The breakfast staff was not that friendly, but it did seem that they were working hard, so I won't begrudge them for not being more pleasant when I asked them for some half-and-half that was out.. This hotel also only provided 3 towels even though our reservation was for four people. Normally, I don't mind going to the front desk and picking up another towel, but I had to go outside and cross a dark alley to get to the front desk, so combined with my impressions, this didn't make me happy.

The only thing missing from my list is a wet spa although they do have large, outdoor heated spas with hot robes & towels in a nearby cabinet. Let me tell you something about timing & the hotel's pricing. We were there the week after Thanksgiving and before the mountains were open and only paid about $500 per night for a one-bedroom suite. The week of Thanksgiving that room was $1,000 nightly and IF you want to spend the week between Christmas & New Year's there, as I write this the price of my $500 room is FIVE THOUSAND dollars per night. It's a nice, comfy room but I'd want a penthouse with a butler & cook for that kind of money. I guess it'supply and demand at work---and I suppose a lot of \"the rich & famous just HAVE to be in Aspen that week regardless of the expense.

For the price and its location right on Main Street within walking distance to \"downtown\" it's a great value for Aspen. The trade offs are that it's right on Main Street so it tends to be a bit loud with the road noise. Also, during the summer the room gets hot and there is no A/C so you're forced to leave the window open just to get some air. The room does have a large ceiling fan and they also provide a large, tall floor fan that helped get the air flowing but it was still warm sleeping even though it cools off at night in the mountains. To make matters worse, we were woken up early each morning to a pair of magpies squawking at each other outside the window on the roof next door! But, all irritations aside, the room was clean, the kitchenette (equipped with a small dorm sized frig, sink, microwave, cook top and limited pans and utensils as well as plates and silverware) was really handy and you still couldn't beat the value in comparison to the other overpriced accommodations elsewhere in Aspen!

Even going in with realistic expectations and a very easygoing personality, the experience at this location was disappointing from the first stop at the front desk until departure. From a front desk that doesn't seem to practice active listening to the rules sheet they give out at check-in, I got the feeling that this was a place that saw their customers as a nuisance.

When we went down one night at 10pm, we were told it was closed and were kicked out.  It was embarrassing and the staff didn\u2019t seem to care at all.", "3.\tHousekeeping seems to run and rule this place with an iron fist \u2013 First off, the checkout time is a ridiculous 10am.  I have never seen a property of this caliber with such an absurdly early check-out time.  If you want to stay longer, you have to call or come down the morning of check out and beg. I did this and the person at the front desk had to call housekeeping and ask them what was the latest I could check out.  11am, even though the person confirmed that there was no one staying in the room that night.  Even with the generosity, it was annoying because housekeeping was banging on the door at 8am (with a do not disturb sign) asking if we wanted service.  It was our last day \u2013 we were checking out.  Odd request.  Then at 10am exactly, they were banging on the door again asking if we were leaving.  Obviously, the 11am checkout we were so kindly given was not communicated.  More than once, it seemed like the staff had to defer to housekeeping to get anything done and ask permission.

I seriously could not understand what I was getting for this price. I had stayed at a Hyatt Place in Denver the night before and they offered more with no resort fee. What was most disturbing to me was how cheap this place was as you could not even get a 20 cent bottle of water included in your room for the $25 resort fee.  When you travel to the mountains (8,000 feet!) you hear \u201cdrink water \u2013 stay hydrated\u201d constantly.

The bed was comfortable ", "There was a morning continental breakfast included \u2013 maybe that\u2019s part of the resort fee?  It was pretty sparse but I knew that going in.  The area where they have the breakfast is also used as a whiskey bar. This was the coolest room at the property as it was completely updated and very nice. The entire hotel could use an upgrade to something more modern, yet rustic, like this room.  ", "At night, there is a wonderful firepit that I enjoyed sitting by.  You have to ask to have it turned on and sometimes there is a wait for that.  Luckily, it was not extinguished at exactly 11pm as said in the massive rule sheet.", "If I spent 30,000 points a night here versus the Park Hyatt Sydney I would feel cheated.  I am going to assume that the kind of people who sign up for vacation clubs have lower standards because I would be incredibly annoyed if this is what I had to deal with. The overwhelming feeling to me was that customers were an annoyance and they already had your money, so why bother trying as hard.  The thing the Hyatt Aspen has going for it is location.

We were at this motel for 5 days.This was a late summer getaway, so we were looking for value accommodations.  We are very familiar with Aspen. We have visited in the summer and winter many times. We usually stay downtown at Independence Square, Aspen Square or Mountain Chalet. This motel is an older property about 5 minutes out of town near the airport. Each unit is owned individually...hence, the difference in reviews. Our room included a comfortable King bed (with temperpedic like mattress...very comfortable). There was a sofa, 2 large chairs, desk and TV credenza. The shower had one sink and tub/shower. Water was hot and the pressure was good. Our room configuration allowed us to pull our car right up to a door and small outside balcony. Very convenient! Check in was quick and efficient. The lobby was updated and inviting. The restaurant (where we enjoyed daily breakfast (at our cost), and dinners on the outside patio and inside was delicious. Best barbecue in town. Outside, the property faces Buttermilk. There is a nice pool, hot tub and large fire pit. The property has an on call shuttle which will take you into town and up to Highlands to catch the Maroon Bells shuttle. It will also take you to the airport. We saw many flight crews coming into and out of this hotel. There is a guest laundry, but the area was being renovated. The front desk graciously told us to bring our laundry to the front desk and they would wash, dry, fold at no charge. Really appreciated this! We spent our days in Aspen, Maroon Bells, Pine Creek Cookhouse. My husband rented a bike and I followed in the car to Ashcroft. We took the bus to Maroon bells with a picnic. The Aspen trees are stunning with shades of gold and red now. Very different than the silver leaves we are used to. The only thing I would recommend to Wyndam is to require the individual owners to update their units on a regular basis with some sort of standard required. New plumbing, carpet, mattresses, bedding. This way, visitors won't encounter such a difference in rooms."]},

It was a unique and interesting experience. She was extremely hospitable, the hotel itself is immaculately decorated and has a charm to it like no other! We stayed in the princess Diana room, which is surrounded by stunning mirrors and beautiful wood which adds a great contrast to the room. It has two separate bedrooms, one room has an oversized king bed and the other room (separated by the bathroom) has a queen sized bed. The amazing bathroom is massive with a fantastic jacuzzi bathtub. The double vanity sinks in the bathroom are as detailed and beautiful as everything else that I have discussed so far. The detail in this room and even in the bathroom are noted for it feels, as if Terry had taken a piece of herself and placed it in each and every single one of her rooms. The rest of the rooms are all just as wonderful and  as nice as the princess Diana room, there is a suite which is massive and spacious as you would think a suit should be,  it is loft style and plenty of other rooms too on the second floor as well as the first. Again the suit has Terry's own touch from handcrafted authentic wood, plentiful of plants and plenty of other gems that you have to just go and see for yourself. I can't express how homie everything feels In this hotel, once you meet Terry and her gracious hospitality, you will soon realize and understand that you are truly staying at a very unique beautiful home. I would have to use the word hotel lightly here because it does not feel as your standard hotel with systematic rooms, although the service is there if not 100 times better, and other amenities you would expect at a hotel, the ambience and homie feels this magical place gives off is unique and frankly unexplainable.  It's not very big, and is booked so plan accordingly. When Terry gave us a quick tour of each room, each room seemed to tell a different story, with different antiques and paintings and style in each room. It was all  luxuriously decorated and really I am at a loss for words as to how beautiful all the rooms and foyer/lobby are. It was truly one of the best hotel experiences I've had and I'm well traveled around the US and Europe. In addition, to the outstanding rooms, and decoration, The Residence Hotel is also in the center of Aspen with shopping, dining and transportation right around the corner, you can't beat that!

The windows in the room were perfect sizes and could easily open to let air in. Not to mention the beautiful views out of the window, we woke up and saw the sun rise over the mountains almost every morning. We stayed in the French room and it truly felt like we were in France. Terry was wonderful and made us feel right at home. She was very genuine and personable, which made the experience even better than it already was. It honestly did not even feel like we were staying at a hotel, but at a friend's beautiful home.

Stayed for two nights to check out Ajax and Highlands. The staff is so helpful and friendly and the rooms are clean/comfortable/spacious. We're a ski family and have to travel often for competitions so we've stayed in our fair share of moderately - somewhat reasonably priced motels and hotels. Two things set Molly Gibson apart- the truly warm pool (yay) and the included breakfast/apres ski. Places always say the pool is heated, and then either the heaters aren't working properly or it's just not warm. This pool was like, hot! Loved not having to just hang in the hot tub. Breakfast and apres ski are in the lodgey restaurant space in the back section. Breakfast is a true meal with plenty of options, from cereal to hot options. Apres ski opens up in the late afternoon and it was relaxing to have some wine and apps while the kids pulled out a board game and watched a little TV. It's a great community atmosphere down there. And given that you can pretty much just make this a dinner if you're not a huge eater, it's a great value that you basically have two meals included with your stay. Last thing I thought was great was the ease of getting over to the base. The bus drives literally right outside the door of the lodge. Runs very frequently and just a few minutes over to the base area. Other option is to get to other mountains through the other buses (depot is at that base area). You can also walk right over (about a 10 minute jaunt) but the bus is so easy, that we didn't bother. But we did walk around at night, which was lovely with the holiday lights up and everyone getting ready for Christmas. The kids love the playground in the public area near the base so they were happy to throw snow clothes on one evening and go play after getting to see Santa driving around on a fire truck with \"Blue Christmas\" blaring! Clearly I recommend staying here and I'm sure we will again in the future."]},

In many ways it reminds me of the lodge my parents ran in Aspen - a small, well cared for family business with a Bavarian flair. Considering its age, this lodge is in extremely good shape inside and out. We stayed in a top-floor room and found it to be clean, spacious, and comfortable. It had a kitchenette with a fridge, 2 burner cooktop, microwave, and all the basic cookware one could need to reheat some leftovers, whip up a bowl of chili or soup, or make a nice cup of tea in the evening. The bath looked as if it had been remodeled fairly recently, and it was in tip-top shape. We spent two very comfortable and restful nights here, and enjoyed being within easy walking distance of downtown. Based on our searches, we found it to also be one of the most reasonably priced hotels in Aspen, especially given we were there in what is considered peak ski season. The staff was very friendly, and the hotel was very quiet at night, though given it is right on Main Street there will be a bit more noise in the morning as the rush hour commute ramps up. My hubby and I really enjoyed our stay here, and this will very likely be our lodging of choice on subsequent visits to Aspen. I would not hesitate to recommend it wholeheartedly to family or friends. It has a rustic charm that harkens back to an Aspen that was a bit less of a playground catering to the wealthy and famous and a bit more of a quaint mountain hamlet with a close-knit community."]},

The parking is right out front. Its only 3 stories tall with 1 st floor descending down so a rather small motel & easily accessible to every room. We had 3 beds in our room ( 2 queens & a twin) & every room have these funky fireplaces. There are microwaves & mini fridges in the room as well as a stove top ~ all clean. Our only snafu was confusion on how many nights we were staying despite having paid in full for 2 nights 2 months prior. Not sure what was up with that but in the end it luckily didn't effect us ( hopefully no one else) just caused a bit of temporary stress no one wants to deal with on vacay.

What ever I needed was no problem....  updates on new restaurants in the area, tips on how to get around, welcome drinks on arrival, amenities kits when I ran out of toothpaste, extra towels for the hot tub, and umbrellas when it rained. The hotel rooms were beyond what I was expecting too. The room decor is brand new and contemporary in design. My room had a log burning fireplace, complete with logs , matches and fire starters replenished every morning.the king size bed was so comfortable!!  and I'm a bit of a clean freak,  but I can assure you, for even the most committed germaphobes... you dont have to worry here. This place comes equipped with the best cleaning crew in America!!!  Absolute perfection! Lastly... did I mention the free breakfast and apres ski offerings prepared by a very handsome young Carlos?

Couldn't ask for more and would certainly stay again.  I don't believe their is AC, however - we didn't need it but I can imagine it might get a bit warm in the heart of the summer."]},
